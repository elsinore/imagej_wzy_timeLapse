# To run this plugin
Download ***WZY_Time_Lapse.ijm*** and drop it to your imagej.
The example image [***Calcium_Oscillation_ExampleImage.zip***](https://github.com/wong-ziyi/imagej_wzy_timeLapse/tree/master/Example) can be directly droped into your imagej.
# imagej_wzy_timeLapse
1. It is better to use Fiji (https://fiji.sc/) instead of imagej, since Fiji no need to set up all plugin that this macro needs. Fiji is just imagej(https://fiji.sc/), so if it can not work in imagej then please Fiji(https://fiji.sc/).
2. Copy this WZY_Time_Lapse.ijm file to your the plugins directory of your Fiji software.
3. Make ROI for the entire image and for each cell (or just target cells).


Welcome to [contact me](https://wong-ziyi.github.io), I am glad to help for making some customized imagej plugins.
